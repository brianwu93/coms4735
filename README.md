Final Project for COMS 4735: Visual Interfaces for Computers. Computer vision drumset and theremin.

Producing music is now easier than any time in history; with the advent of mobile devices, contemporary musicians can create a wide-range of sounds using very little gear. Countless mobile apps already simulate pianos, guitars, and the like through touchscreens on tablets and smartphones. In fact, stripped down to fundamentals, a physical instrument simply reacts to a motion or gesture and converts the action into sound. As a significant portion of our class is also focused on converting visual stimuli into actionable results, weâ€™ve decided to create a visual theremin and drums for our final project, two instruments that will use hand gesture to produce sound in a predetermined manner. Both instruments will use nothing aside from webcams to capture and classify hand positions, which are then converted to the correct sounds to be emitted from a laptop:

##Theremin
A theremin is an instrument already made for hand gestures, although typically using capacitors. We will build a traditional theremin that determines the frequency and amplitude of the sound based on hand position (either height / width or depth).

##Drums
For drums, we plan to have the webcam facing a flat surface where certain segments of the surface represents a part of a drum kit. We will include a printed mat with colored segments to help the user determine where to hit for the correct drum.
